# React Developer Case Study Project
Built by making api get calls to Hackernews.  It's a great source of tech-related news. They provide a public API at https://hackernews.api-docs.io.

The goal is to make a react web application to make it easier to navigate the news:

- Display a selection of the latest top stories;
- Scroll down to reload and get newer stories;
- As there are many stories I used lazy loading when I display them.
- ## Built With üî®
